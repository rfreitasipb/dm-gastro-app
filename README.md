# Multiplatform Development Project

This project is developed as part of the curriculum for the "Desenvolvimento Multiplataforma" lecture for the 2LEI F class. It is designed to demonstrate key concepts and practical implementations of mobile application development using Expo CLI and React Native.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. The project is set up with Expo CLI, which simplifies the initial setup and development of React Native applications.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, you need to have Node.js installed on your computer. It is recommended to install Node using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager) to handle multiple versions easily. You will also need the Expo CLI installed.

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

### Installing

To get the project running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rfreitasipb/dm-gastro-app.git
   cd your-project-folder
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Expo development server:**

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
  or
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```


   These commands will start the Expo developer tools in your browser.

4. **Run the application:**
   - **Expo Go:** Scan the QR-CODE with the Expo Go app to start the application.
   - **Android:** Use an Android emulator or connect your Android device to your computer and enable USB debugging. Press `a` in your terminal to start the application.
   - **iOS:** Press `i` in your terminal to launch the iOS Simulator if you are on a Mac and have it installed.

### Useful Tips

- To view logs directly in the terminal, you can shake your Android device or use the command `d` in the iOS Simulator to bring up the developer menu, then select 'Debug JS Remotely'.

- To access the Expo developer tools in your browser, scan the QR code in the terminal or visit the URL given by the Expo start command.
